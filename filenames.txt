soy had the frog in his hands within seconds.
he was always good with outdoorsy stuff like that.
his mom was usually busy with his siblings, so soy was left to play outside a lot.
by third grade, he had caught a pet turtle, salamander, and flying squirrel.
unfortunately, his older brothers rick and hank stole the squirrel and kept it in their room.
once a week they played a game where rick threw the squirrel from the second story window, and hank caught it midair with a trash can as it glided down.
soy tried to get them to stop, but they never listened.
it wasn’t until a particularly windy fall day that he caught a gust and flew over their heads to freedom.
the frog didn’t put up much of a fight.
i started to wonder if it actually wanted to be caught.
“do you believe me now?” i asked.
soy peaked inside his hands, and then lifted his head with wide eyes.
"well… this frog is wearing glasses.
i’ll give you that.”
both of our minds were racing with questions.
“let’s bring it to my treehouse, so we can figure this out,” i said.
i had built most of the treehouse in my backyard myself.
my mom and dad insisted on one of them being there when i used certain tools, but that was about it.
building things always made me feel good afterwards, and i had gotten pretty good at it.
the treehouse had been done for a while, but there were still a few things i wanted to add to it before winter.
